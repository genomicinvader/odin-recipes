    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These savory, spicy beef samosas are wonderful. My friend from Bangladesh
      gave me this recipe. You just can't buy better in the shops!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf, crushed</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped green chile peppers</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in
        potatoes and peas; cook until potatoes are tender but still firm, about
        15 minutes. Drain, mash together, and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium-high
        heat. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf; stir until fragrant and seeds are
        browned. Add ground beef and onions; cook until beef is browned and
        crumbly and onions are soft, about 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stir in garlic and ginger. Season with salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric,
        chili powder, cinnamon, cardamom, and black pepper. Stir in the mashed
        potato mixture. Remove from heat and chill in the refrigerator for 1
        hour, or until cool.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Heat 1 quart of oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix cilantro and green chile peppers into potato and beef mixture. Place
        approximately 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto each phyllo sheet. Fold
        sheets into triangles, pressing edges together with moistened fingers.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Lower samosas carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden
        brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
        Repeat with remaining samosas. Serve warm.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>Chicken livers may be substituted for beef if you prefer.</p>
    <h2>Editor's Note:</h2>
    <p>
      We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a
      retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on
      cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil
      used.
