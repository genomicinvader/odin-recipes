        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These simple homemade smash burgers have crispy edges and are super juicy inside. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>
